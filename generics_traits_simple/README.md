# Global Traits with Generics
## Overview
This project is a demonstration of how to create and implement global traits with generics in Rust. These traits are designed to be flexible and reusable across different projects, making them an essential tool for building modular and scalable Rust applications.

### Features

Global Traits:

Define traits that can be used globally across your projects.
These traits are generic, allowing them to be implemented for various types, providing flexibility and reusability.

### Generic Parameters:

Use of Rustâ€™s powerful generics system to create traits that are not tied to a specific type.
This makes the traits versatile and adaptable to different contexts and data types.

### Reusability:

Once defined, these traits can be implemented in any project that requires their functionality.
This reduces code duplication and enhances the maintainability of your codebase.

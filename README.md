### Overview 
Welcome to my Rust code examples repository! This collection contains various small examples, demos, and experiments that I've created in my free time. These snippets are built just for fun and to explore different concepts in Rust. They also serve as a handy reference for anyone interested in learning Rust or looking for code examples.

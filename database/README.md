# Database Connections in Rust

## Overview

This Rust project is a playful exploration of establishing database connections using different database systems. It includes functions for connecting to PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQLite, and Microsoft SQL Server (MSSQL), demonstrating both synchronous and asynchronous connection methods.

## Features

### PostgreSQL Connections:

## Asynchronous:
Connect to a PostgreSQL database asynchronously using Tokio.

## Synchronous: 
Connect to a PostgreSQL database synchronously.
Oracle Connections:

## Synchronous: 
Establish a connection to an Oracle database synchronously.
### SQLite Connections:

## Synchronous: 
Connect to a SQLite database synchronously.
### MSSQL Connections:

## Asynchronous: 
Connect to a Microsoft SQL Server (MSSQL) database asynchronously using Tokio.

### Connection Pooling:

Create a connection pool to manage multiple PostgreSQL connections efficiently.

Usage

These functions are here for fun and to showcase how to establish connections to various databases in Rust. You can use them as a starting point for your own projects, or simply to learn more about database connectivity in Rust.
